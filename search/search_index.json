We will walk through all of the functionality following this scheme: From top to bottom in the left side of the window you will see, Event Info. This small box let enter information about an event, in this way you can plot the theoretical arrivals (ak-135F) with respect your seismograms. Files. By clicking in this button you will place the path of your files ( miniseed or sac). Metadata. By clicking in this button you will place the path to you metadata file. The metadata file must contain the information of all of the stations seismograms you want to analyze (metadata must be a xml or dlsv). Start Time and End Time. The time boxes can be selected checking \u201cTrim Time\u201d. If you choose this option all the seismograms will be cut in accordance with the selected time window. Stations Info will deploy a table with the fundamental information of the seismograms. Phase box. This combo box allow the selection of specific phases for picking it in the seismograms. Waves box. You can Choose Body, surface, coda or noise. With this selected you can highlight a time window of the seismogram for further analysis. Net, Station and Channel. You can fill this boxes (also using wildcards) to select specific files from your files folder (check \u201cselect files\u201d). Locate. After pick some phases in your seismogram you can locate an earthquake and show a location map. Previously you must have calculated travel-times for your velocity model (Further details in Event Location tab. 2.3) Stations Map will show you the location of the stations that corresponds to the seismograms of your folder. The seismograms metadata must match with the metadata information. Rotate. This option will rotate all your station - 3 components (must be named N,E,Z) to the GAC taking the reference the data of event info. Cross. This button will compute the cross-correlation (cc) or the autocorrelation of all processed seismograms with respect the reference \u201cRef\u201d, the number of the seismogram from top to bottom. Process and Plot. This action will read the seismograms from the selected folder and will carry out the processing from the established \u201cMACRO\u201d. Further details in MACRO section \"Macros\".","title":"Earthquake Location"},{"location":"el/#earthquake-location","text":"The module Earthquake analysis allows you to analyze waveforms, polarization analysis of seismograms 3-components, calculate different magnitudes and finally locate an event and estimate the focal mechanism (First Polarity).
