First you need to create a coordinates files and then load it. To create the coordinate file go to \u201cFiles >>> Stations Coordinates\u201d and fill the table with lat (o), lon (o) and depth (km). Then you can compute the ARF and plot the map with the array stations. Frequency-Wavenumber Analysis The Frequency-Wavenumber (FK) is basically a method to compute the beamforming in the frequency domain (Capon, 1969). To compute the FK you need follow this steps; Files: Path where you have the seismograms Dataless: path where you have the metadata ( .dlsv or .xml) Set temporal window of the analysis and check the box Trim Plot the seismograms Fill the parameters (Slowness Max, Time Window, overlap\u2026\u2026) Choose methods Press Run F-K Now, you will watch in the upper panels the Rel Power, Absolute Power, Back-Azimuth and Slowness results of your analysis. Two more actions: Double pick in the upper panels will run the FK in that specific time window (starting in the point). Then, the slowness map and the stack corresponding to the delays of the maximum power in the slowness vector will show up. The pick with the slowness vector corresponding to the phase you selected are automatically saved in the file \u201cisp/arrayanalysis/dataframe.csv\u201d and you can open the file just pressing \u201cctrl+o\u201d Vespagram The vespagram is a visualization of the FK results for an specific backazimuth or slowness. So, once you have done the FK analysis, you can compute the vespagram (Rost and Thomas, 2002). But before, you must select the time window. Go with the mouse to the any upper panel. Pick, hold and drag to the right direction to do the selection. Now you can open the vespagram window. In the vespagram window you can select the parameters (Win length, overlap, and frequency bandwidth of the analysis) and the backazimuth and slowness where you want to compute the vespagram.","title":"Array Analysis"},{"location":"aa/#array-analysis","text":"","title":"Array Analysis"},{"location":"aa/#array-response-function-arf","text":"The Array Response Function (ARF) (Ruigrok et al., 2017) helps to evaluate the resolution of the array in a specific bandwidth.

Multimedia Material The following video shows a basic analysis of an earthquake Polarisation Analysis The Polarization Analysis is designed to analyze the three seismograms components from a station. You can freely rotate using the rotation RT or the LQT your NEZ components an angle (Rot Angle) with an Incidence angle (Inc Angle). The Particle motion of the processed seismogram is view clicking in \u201cPlot Polarization\u201d. This option will plot all the time window in a 3D view and in three 2D plot views. If you want to make a sliding window analysis of the polarization press \u201cPolarization Analysis\u201d. This will carry out a polarization analysis on windows length and frequency bandwidth specified by the user over the full analyzed seismogram. For a full particle motion analysis, press \u201cPlot Polarization\u201d. This will open another window with a 3D particle motion on the left and the three characteristic views on the right. Event Location and Focal Mechanism (FP) In the Event Location Frame the user can configurate the velocity grid 1D/3D model, locate earthquakes and compute Focal Mechanisms. First it is needed to set a Velocity grid framework (Grid reference and transformation type are mandatory). For now is only available Transformation Simple and Global. Next, the Grid dimensions (Grid Size). Case 2D the dimension always must be 2 and the grid reference is referred to the corner SW. Case 3D the grid reference is the center of the Grid. Choose the grid type and the wave and then generate the velocity model binary files by clicking \u201cGenerate Velocity Grid\u201d. Once the binary files are generated you can check the results in the folder: ISP/earthquakeAnalysis/location_output/model Where and how place the velocity models? 2D models (see example) LAYER 0.0 6.1 0.0 3.49 0.0 2.7 0.0 LAYER 11.0 6.4 0.0 3.66 0.0 2.7 0.0 LAYER 24.0 6.9 0.0 3.94 0.0 2.7 0.0 LAYER 31.0 8.0 0.0 4.57 0.0 2.7 0.0 ISP/earthquakeAnalysis/location_output/local_models 3D models ISP/earthquakeAnalysis/location_output /model3D (see example) Every depth layer must be placed in files called, for example Layer.P.mod5.mod Which means that inside this file there is the grid for the layer at depth 5km. The layer must be a matrix with the values in the rows from top to bottom E to W and from left to right S to W The most important step is to generate the travel-times for all the stations inside the maximum distance the user determine. Please be sure that you have load the metadata previously in seismogram analysis. The generated travel-times will save in ISP/earthquakeAnalysis/location_output/time Once you have complete the above steps you can locate the earthquake and the focal mechanism. **For global is not necessary generate the velocity grid and travel times. To visualize the detailed Probability Density Function, press \u201cPlot PDF\u201d once you have already carried out the location.

The program can be used to perform the H-k stacking (Zhu & Kanamori, 2000) of the receiver functions for the determination of the crustal thickness and VP/VS ratio, as well as the back-tracing and CCP (\u2018common-conversion point\u2019) stacking. The first step in the receiver function analysis consists in cutting a time window containing the P-wave arrivals for each earthquake and station. The \u2018Cut earthquakes\u2019 tool requires that the data we want to work with is available locally and can be accessed from the Menu Bar under \u2018Tools > Cut earthquakes \u2026\u2019 (Fig. 1). Fig. 1. Screenshot of the 'Cut earthquakes' tool. The numbers in the image are referred to in the text below. The \u2018Raw data\u2019 and \u2018XML/dataless\u2019 fields [1] must point to the directory containing our mseed data and the StationXML/dataless file for the instruments used to record the data (which must contain the location of the stations at least, and the instrumental responses if we wish to remove them). The \u2018Quick file search\u2019 checkbox can be used to quickly index the input files if they follow the naming convention \u201cYEAR.JULDAY.LOC.STATION.CHANNEL.mseed\u201d. If they do not, simply uncheck this option and the code will read the .mseed file headers instead. The buttons labeled with \u2018\u2026\u2019 [2] can be used to select the correct paths through the file explorer. The output of the \u2018Cut earthquakes\u2019 tool consists in a directory containing the windowed earthquakes for each station [3], and a metadata file [4] containing information about each event such as the origin time, location, azimuth, ray parameter, etc. The output paths for these files must also be set by the user. Under the \u2018Settings\u2019 section we can tune a few parameters regarding event selection, quality control and time windowing of the records. The determination of the P-wave arrival time to each station is performed automatically using the TauPy package and the information contained in a event catalog downloaded from a Web Service [5]. The \u2018Earth model\u2019 used in the TauPy computations can be selected using a drop-down menu [6]. The starting and ending dates for the event catalog can be set using [7]. The minimum magnitude of the selected events, the minimum and maximum epicentral distances (in degrees), the minimum acceptable signal-to-noise ratio for each event, and the start and end of the time window to cut from the local record relative to the P-wave arrival time can be set using [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. The coordinate system in which we want to work, \u2018LQT\u2019 for Q-receiver functions or \u2018ZRT\u2019 for R-receiver functions, can be set using a drop-down menu [14]. Fig. 2. Selection of the metadata file provided in the ISP example files. Estimate RFs Once the P-wave records are cut, the metadata file and a directory with the structure output/station/mseed files should have been created (the output path was set in the \u2018Cut earthquakes\u2019 tool, fields [3] and [4]). To compute and start working with the receiver functions, load the metadata file using the Main menu bar option \u2018Input > Read event data file \u2026\u2019 (Fig. 2). Triggering this option will open the file explorer. Once the metadata file has been successfully loaded, read the P-wave records under \u2018Input > RF Analysis > Read waveforms \u2026\u2019. A new instance of the file explorer will be opened (Fig. 3). It is important that the root directory containing the different station folders (field [3] chosen in the \u2018Cut earthquakes\u2019 tool) is selected, as the directory structure will allow the code to sort the data correctly. In this example, we will use the P-wave recordings and metadata file provided with ISP. These were created from 4 years of continuous recordings of the IU.PAB station (2002 to 2006) downloaded from the IRIS DMC. After correctly selecting the example files, the station \u2018PAB\u2019 will appear in the Water-level deconvolution panel [15] (Fig. 4). The Water-level deconvolution settings include a bandpass filter that is applied to the waveforms prior to deconvolution, with corner frequencies f1 and f2 [16], the width of the low-pass Gaussian filter used in the deconvolution [17], and the water-level itself [18]. These parameters should be tuned to obtain the best results for each individual station, but the default values are usually a good starting point. Once the settings are set, press the \u2018Compute RFs\u2019 button [19] and the receiver functions will appear on the panel [20]. A maximum of 7 receiver functions are displayed at once. Scroll through the different pages using the \u2018<\u2019 and \u2018>\u2019 buttons on the bottom right side of the panel [21]. Poor-quality receiver functions can be discarded by left-clicking on them, and reaccepted by left-clicking again (Fig. 5). Right clicking on the frame of a receiver function will display the waveform from which it was calculated. The \u2018Analysis tools\u2019 panel [22] can be used to change the time range displayed [23], sort the display order of the receiver functions [24] by back-azimuth or distance, discard all events lower than a certain magnitude [25] or remove all rejections, manual or automatic, and accept all receiver functions [26]. The \u2018Receiver function stack\u2019 panel [27] is intended to give the user an overview of all the available receiver functions in use, in order to facilitate their inspection and the detection of poor quality receiver functions that may be harming the results. The stack of all receiver functions is shown in the top part of this panel [28] and stacks at regular intervals of backazimuth or epicentral distance are shown on the bottom panel [29]. The size of these intervals and any desired overlap between them can be adjusted using the fields [30] and [31]. A \u2018Ps\u2019 phase moveout correction can be applied by selecting it in the [32] drop-down menu. To display the stack, simply press the \u2018Update plot\u2019 button [33]. The \u2018H-k stack\u2019 panel [34] displays the results of the H-k stacking, based on Zhu & Kanamori (2000). The code uses the semblance-weighted stacking method proposed by Eaton et al. (2006). The density of crustal thickness \u2013 Vp/Vs ratio (k) points for the H-k matrix can be adjusted using the fields [35], although the default value should be more than enough. The crustal thickness \u2013 Vp/Vs value ranges can be set using the fields [36], and the weights for the Ps, PpPs and PpSs+PsPs phases can be set using the fields [37]. Two widely used sets of weights are 0.70, 0.20, 0.10 and 0.34, 0.33, 0.44 for Ps, PpPs and PpSs+PsPs, respectively. Once satisfied with the parameters, press the \u2018Compute H-k stack\u2019 button. The H-k matrix will be shown, and the location of the maximum will be marked with two white lines. The uncertainty is displayed as a green ellipse and is computed following Eaton et al. (2006). The values and uncertainties for both parameters are shown in two labels below the H-k plot [38], [39]. The results for the PAB station example are H = 31.42, k = 1.73. The EARS result for this station are H = 32 km, k = 1.76 (http://ears.iris.washington.edu/Data/Summary/gauss_2.5/WM/UCM/station.html, last seen 26/01/2021). The event panel is located in the bottom right side of the main window [40] and displays the location of all the events used in the H-k computations. To generate this figure, simply press the \u2018Plot events\u2019 button [41]. For reference, two circles indicating 30 and 90 degrees of epicentral distance from the station are also displayed. After the H-k maximum is determined, the theoretical arrival times of the Ps, PpPs and PpSs+PsPs phases can be displayed on the \u2018Receiver function stack\u2019 panel for reference. For this, check the box labeled as \u2018Show theoretical arrival times\u2019 [42] and press the button \u2018Update plot\u2019 [33]. Two types of results can be saved: the receiver functions (which will be used in the second chapter of this tutorial) and the H-k maximum coordinates, pressing buttons \u2018Save RFs\u2019 [43] and \u2018Save results\u2019 [44], respectively. Both options open a file dialog. The \u2018Save RFs\u2019 [43] function requires the user to select an output folder where the receiver functions for the current station will be dumped as a Python pickle file. The \u2018Save results\u2019 [44] will output the H-k results in .csv format, creating a new file if it doesn\u2019t exist, or appending to an existing file if selected. Figures of the Receiver function stack, the H-k stack, and the event location plot can be saved using the corresponding \u2018Save figure\u2019 button, which will display the Save figure dialog. The \u2018Save figure\u2019 dialog creates a .png or .pdf image of the data being displayed in the main user interface. Height, width, and quality of the figure (DPI) can be chosen, as well as the size of the margins and the figure labels. Fig. 4. Screenshot of the main window. The numbers in the image are referred to in the text above* Back-tracing and CCP stacking of RFs After the receiver functions have been computed and undergone a visual quality control, they can be saved using the \u2018Save RFs\u2019 feature ([43], Fig. 4). The resulting files can be loaded back into the program for the back-tracing and CCP stacking of the receiver functions. The first step is to load the event metadata file produced in the previous chapter. If it is already loaded for the H-k analysis, it will not be necessary to load it again. The second step is to read the saved receiver functions. This can be done under \u2018Input > CCP Stacking > Read RFs \u2026\u2019. Triggering this option will display an open file dialog, in which the directory containing the receiver function files must be selected. Once loaded, switch to the \u201cCCP Stacking\u201d tab in the main window. A map of the stations with available receiver functions will be in display.
